You can use\r\nthe sample file provided in the distribution as a starting point\r\nafter reading the timeoutd.8 and timeouts.5 man pages.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the timeouts file in /etc, you can type:\r\n\r\nmake install\r\n\r\nto install the timeoutd binaries and man pages.\r\n\r\nThen it is just a matter of running /usr/bin/timeoutd.  You may want\r\nto add a line to your /etc/rc or /etc/rc.local (or whatever) to run\r\ntimeoutd at boot time.\r\n\r\nIf you wish, you can also modify your login programme to have timeoutd\r\nrun at login time to check whether each user is allowed to login or not.\r\nOtherwise, users who are not allowed to login will be logged off within\r\n1 minute of logging in.\r\n\r\nAnother (albeit less certain) way of doing this is to put the following\r\nline in /etc/profile near the top of the file:\r\n\r\n/usr/bin/timeoutd `whoami` `basename \\`tty\\`` || exit\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease sends bugs, comments, suggestions to:\r\nshanea@bigpond.net.au (Shane Alderton)\r\n"}
